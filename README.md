# futures-trading-backtest
A program that backtests a simple futures trend-following strategy.
This was a program that I wrote in 2021, so there are a lot of inefficiencies in the code. 
I might update it in the future to run faster and accommodate more strategies.
The actual program is the file named "System 5.3 (breakout + trend filter + ATR stops) .ipynb"
